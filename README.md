# Waze Traffic Analysis

Waze Traffic Analysis is web app that performs large scale analytics on Waze data

More specifically, I gathered San Francisco Traffic data via a sort of unofficial data collection method.  The resulting data was very messy, so need to do lot of cleaning and preprocessing, which was then used to perform analytics on a number of metrics that seemed interesting.
